# Data_Structure_and_Algorithms
Some naive codes of basic abstract data types and traditional algorithms. The exercises for data structure are mainly from what're give by Udem.

Basic abstract data types:
* queue, stack
* linked list
* heap
* hash table

Traditional algorithms:
* sorting
* greedy algorithm: MST(Kruskal, Prim), Shortes path(Dijkstra), returning money, knapsacks.
* Dynamic programming: Shortest path (Floyd), returning money, knapsacks.

To check the details of each exercise, see the file folder pdf.

There are many errors remaining to be fixed, to be continue.
